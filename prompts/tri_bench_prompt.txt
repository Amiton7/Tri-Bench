The image shows triangle ABC whose vertices are the centres of three small coloured square stickers: A=RED, B=YELLOW, C=BLUE.
A light-brown masking-tape square border surrounds the scene in the same plane as triangle ABC.
All questions refer to triangle ABC. Angles are in DEGREES. "angle ABC" denotes the interior angle at vertex B.
Round all numeric answers to EXACTLY 4 decimals.

Q1. Is triangle ABC equilateral, isosceles, or scalene?
Q2. Is triangle ABC acute, right, or obtuse?
Q3. In triangle ABC, by what factor is the length AB greater than length AC? (i.e., estimate AB / AC)
Q4. In triangle ABC, by how much do angles angle ABC and angle ACB differ? (i.e., estimate |angle ABC - angle ACB| in degrees)
Q5. In triangle ABC, what is (longest side) / (shortest side)?
Q6. In triangle ABC, what is (largest interior angle - smallest interior angle) in degrees?

Return STRICT JSON ONLY (no prose, markdown, code fences, or extra keys).
Use EXACTLY these keys; numbers must have exactly 4 decimals:

- "side_type": one of "equilateral", "isosceles", "scalene"
- "angle_type": one of "acute", "right", "obtuse"
- "ab_over_ac": number with 4 decimals
- "abs_b_minus_c_deg": number with 4 decimals
- "max_over_min_side": number with 4 decimals
- "angle_range_deg": number with 4 decimals

Output only the JSON object with these six keys and the computed values for THIS image.
